## Simple App POC

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
A custom port `3001` has been passed in start script to work parallelly in this monorepo

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
As per this "Proof of Concept" default linting and sourcemap has been disabled through script. Please refer package.json

### Generating Server render markup

Once the build pack is generated after running `npm run build` You can pass the js through a `form-data` request to s-o-c app to see the rendered markup of the js file. Please refer postman under `_docs` folder.

##### Additional details
A lightweight package can be generated by removing the imports in App.js and index.js (this will be handled in the s-o-c app internally)
